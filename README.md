# Question Answering Discord Bot

This bot answers questions using a Hugging Face language model. Mention the bot
with a question and it will reply with an answer.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This bot uses the `fetch` API built into Node 18+. If you are on an
   earlier Node version, install `node-fetch`:
   ```bash
   npm install node-fetch
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env
   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN, DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID, DISCORD_GUILD_ID and HF_TOKEN must be set.

3. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Ensure the bot has permission to send messages in the specified channel.

The bot only responds to messages in the guild and channel IDs provided in
`.env`.

### Testing the Hugging Face request

To test your Hugging Face configuration without running Discord, use:

```bash
npm run hf-test "What is the capital of France?"
```

This sends a real request to the configured model and prints the answer.
